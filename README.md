# US Bikeshare Project

## What the project does
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Using Python, we have built an interactive environment where users can choose the city, month, and day of week to analyze bike share usage patterns. It provides statistics on most common travel times, most popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user statistics.

## Why the project is useful
This project is an excellent tool for city planners, bike share system providers, or anyone interested in understanding the behavior of users in these bike sharing systems. It allows for a detailed examination of the data, revealing trends and patterns that can inform future decisions about system growth, maintenance, and improvement.

## How users can get started with the project
To get started with this project, you'll need a Python environment set up. This project requires Python 3.x and the libraries: pandas, numpy, and time.

The datasets required for this project are provided in .csv format. You will need the data files for the respective cities:

- 'chicago.csv'
- 'new_york_city.csv'
- 'washington.csv'

After setting up the environment and ensuring that the data files are in the correct location, simply run the script. The program will guide you through the steps needed to analyze the data.
